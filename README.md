# rock_paper_scissors
This is my Rock Paper Scissors JavaScript project. In contrast to the rest of projects, this one took a while.
It has been kinda hard to understand JavaScript up to this point. I have had to do a lot of research, and even sometimes use ChatGPT (despite this I made sure I was understanding what I was doing), but I finally managed to finish it after a few days.
I am going to review past JS lessons to make sure I completely understand everything.
